Syntax: solve.n(guess, function_name())
_______________________________________
This will take a guess of the root from the user, and use it to find the actual root of the given function function_name.
It evaluates the point of intersection of the tangent to the function at x = guess with the x-axis, which is an improved guess.
It then keeps iterating this method to improve its guess and eventually reaches the root.
