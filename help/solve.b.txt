This takes in 2 points, having function values of opposite sign, and finds the root lying between them.
It calculates the function value at the midpoint and out of the 2 subintervals created, chooses the one having endpoints with function values of opposite signs, thus implying that the root lies between them (the given function should be continuous). 
It then iterates this method till it finds the root.
