Monte Carlo method

Syntax: integrate.mc(left_limit, right_limit, function_name())
___________________________________________________________
This function will integrate the given function function_name(), which accepts one parameter, over the given interval x=left_limit to x=right_limit.
It finds max and min values of the curve in the interval, so we have the rectangle bounding the curve.
It then plots a large number of random points, checks whether the point is inside or outside the are bounded by the curve and x-axis.
It then divides number of points inside by total points, also accounting for negative area, and multiplies that ratio with the area of the rectangle.
