Partial differentiation in 2D space
__________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: partial_diff2d( x_coord , y_coord , function_name, direction_axis)
__________________________________________________________________________
The x_coord and y_coord are the coordinates of a point at which the function must be
partially differentiated and direction_axis gives us the direction in which it has
to be differentiated i.e. either "x" (if it is to differentiated with respect to x,
keeping y constant) or "y" (if it is to differentiated with respect to y, keeping x
constant).
